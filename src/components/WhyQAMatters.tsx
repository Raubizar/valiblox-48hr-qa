            Why QA Matters in Data Center Projects
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
            Data center construction projects are among the most complex and costly infrastructure investments. 
            A single overlooked detail in drawings, specifications, or 3D models can cascade into massive delays, 
            budget overruns, and operational failures. Traditional QA processes rely heavily on manual reviews 
            that are slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

          <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The stakes couldn't be higher. Data centers require precise coordination between mechanical, electrical, 
            and structural systems. When errors slip through, they don't just cost moneyâ€”they can compromise critical 
            infrastructure that businesses depend on 24/7. Our machine-assisted validation process catches these 
            issues before they become problems, ensuring your project stays on track, on budget, and delivers 
            the reliability your clients expect.
